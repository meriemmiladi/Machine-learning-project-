# Machine-learning-project-
the machine learning project deals with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

Project Description:

With the rapid growth in network-based applications, many security tools have been developed in order to detect malicious activities and attacks. Machine learning methods are considered as one of the predominant approaches to intrusion detection. 

In this context, the ML project aims at reproducing the 2 competitive following papers related to intrusion detection:

- Paper1: Study on Decision Tree and KNN Algorithm for Intrusion Detection System
  For the Paper1, in addition to the KNN and Decision tree models,  SVM, logistic Regression and Ensemble learning models are applied and evaluated.
- Paper2: Anomaly Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Probability Model to Implement Intrusion Detection System

For experiments, the NSL-KDD dataset is used which is provided with a detailed description.
